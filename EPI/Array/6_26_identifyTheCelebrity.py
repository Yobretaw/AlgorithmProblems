    ============================================================================================
    For any two distinct people a and b, a may or may not know b. In the context of this problem,
    the "knows" relation is not necessary symmetric: a may know b, but b may not know a. At a
    party, every one knows someone else. Now a celebrity joins the party - everyone knows him, but
    he knows no one.

    Let F be a n x n boolean 2D array repersenting the "knows" relations for n people - F[a][b]
    is true if and only if a knows b. Design an algorithm to find the celebrity.
